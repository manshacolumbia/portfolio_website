                    With the rising inflation and increase in house prices. I was curious to learn what other factors actually affect the price of a price house apart from inflation. I built a machine learning model to predict the price of an Airbnb property based on 90 different factors such as sqft, location, reviews, etc.
I was among the top 10 best models on the Kaggle website

                    Being in NYC for over 6 months now. I built a close relationship with the concept of bluebikes due to its ease and convenience. While I did some analysis and evaluation on the rebalancing issue of bluebikes. My drive towards the environment led me to think about the positive environmental impact electric city bikes maybe have. This motivated me to perform an analysis of the Air Quality Index of the city in relation to the rise and expansion of bluebikes in the city from 2015 to 2018. Purposely excluded the covid years from the analysis for an unbiased analysis.

                    As an international master’s student, it is extremely important to optimize the job hunt process while having lots of courses from Columbia University. To ease this process for me I created a job recommendation system based on my resume which would give me a match score if the job matches the skills and profile that I have jobs that are recommended for my profile. This is continuing to help me in my job hunt process.

             I love to dig into complex problems and solve them with modern technology. I create, scale, and optimize business solutions that matter. I focus on delivering key outcomes, building optimized software, and quickly adapting to the new learnings. 
I have enjoyed the roles of Business Analyst, Software Developer, and IT manager. My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself.
            <br>•	I am constantly learning because I never settle. <br>
            <br>•	I stay calm when faced with adversity<br>
            <br>•	I focus on making high-quality decisions<br>              
            <br><br>
            I am passionate about coding and I think it is crucial for young people to promote their brain growth. As a volunteer, I taught impoverished kids how to code using Kojo, a language created specifically to help young kids learn to code more quickly.
